### 🎥 Overview

**EVE (Extended Video Export) Community Edition** is an actively maintained continuation of the original

EVE enhances *Grand Theft Auto V*’s **Rockstar Editor** export system — giving creators higher-quality video exports, more control over rendering, and better performance for cinematic production workflows.

This **Community Edition** keeps that vision alive with continued maintenance, modernization, and community-driven improvements.
